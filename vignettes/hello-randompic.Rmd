###About randompic


randompic is a package that will give you a link that takes you to a page with a random picture of a bear, or bacon, etc, and you can select the size of the picture you want. It can also generate a doge meme link, you just have to type the words that you want to appear on the meme.


I got this idea after checking this site: [R for cats](http://rforcats.net)

To install the package:

```{r}
devtools::install_github("bdacunha/randompic")
library(randompic)
```


These are the functions that are included in the package:

+ getbears: let's you insert a link that contains a picture of bears with the specified width and height
+ getbacon: let's you insert a link that contains a picture of bacon with the specified width and height
+ get_corgi: let's you insert a link that contains a picture of a corgi with the specified width and height
+ get_kitty: let's you insert a link that contains a picture of cats with the specified width and height
+ get_random: let's you insert a link that contains a picture of a random animal with the specified width and height
+ getmeme: let's you create a meme using the same picture (doge meme) but changing the words
+ get_beard: let's you insert a link that contains a picture of a bearded man with the specified width and height
+ get_zombies: let's you insert a link that contains a picture of zombies... but beware that you might get scared!


Now here is an example of what my function getbears does:


```{r}
getbears(200, 400)
```


And here is the image from the link

It's really easy to use the other functions as well:


For getbacon: 


```{r}
getbacon(400, 500)
```

If we want a meme we use getmeme:


```{r}
getmeme(c("wow", "soeasy", "greatjob"))
```

randompic is a fun and layback package that will help you entertain yourself and others
