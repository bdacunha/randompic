###About randompic


randompic is a package that will give you a link that takes you to a page with a random picture of a bear, or bacon, etc, and you can select the size of the picture you want.


I got this idea after checking this site: [R for cats](http://rforcats.net)


Now here is an example of what my function does:


```{r}
library(randompic)
getbears(200, 300)
```


And here is the image from the link

We can also create a dogememe:

```{r}
getmeme(c("wow", "greatwork", "lovelyhomework"))
```
